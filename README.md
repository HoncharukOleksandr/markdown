============================================================================

Code for the Advanced Android Kotlin Testing Codelab 5.1-5.3

Introduction
------------

TO-DO Notes is an app where you to write down tasks to complete. The app displays them in a list.
You can then mark them as completed or not, filter them and delete them.

This codelab has four branches, representing different code states:

* [starter_code](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-testing/tree/starter_code)
* [end_codelab_1](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-testing/tree/end_codelab_1)
* [end_codelab_2](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-testing/tree/end_codelab_2)
* [end_codelab_3](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-testing/tree/end_codelab_3)

The codelabs in this series are:
* [Testing Basics](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-basics)
* [Introduction to Test Doubles and Dependency Injection](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-test-doubles)
* [Survey of Testing Topics](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-survey)


Pre-requisites
--------------

You should be familiar with:

* The Kotlin programming language, including [Kotlin coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) and their interaction with [Android Jetpack components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines).
* The following core Android Jetpack libraries: [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel),
 [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata),
  [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) and 
  [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding).
* Application architecture, following the pattern from the [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) and [Android Fundamentals codelabs](https://developer.android.com/courses/kotlin-android-fundamentals/toc).


Getting Started
---------------

1. Download and run the app.
2. Check out one of the codelabs mentioned above.

"Smartypants, double quotes" and 'single quotes'


## Emphasis

**This is bold text**

__This is bold text__

*This is italic text*

_This is italic text_

~~Strikethrough~~


## Blockquotes


> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>> ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.


## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

## Tables

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |

The killer feature of `markdown-it` is very effective support of
[syntax plugins](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/markdown-it-plugin).
